## Tutorial notebooks demonstrating the use of the `event_aug` package

The two notebooks showcase how the package can be used to augment event data recordings using either
- Perlin noise
- A custom movie / video

### Steps

1. Unzip the `data.zip` file which contains all the data required for the tutorial notebooks, including example event recordings, pose data for props, and more. If you wish to augment your own data, it should be in the same format as this example data.
2. Run the notebook of your choice.

**Note:** The notebooks also contain a section on projecting and visualizing the event data. For this, your data needs to have exactly the same structure as described in the notebooks.
